This is how iSpecs works.



Concept Design:-
Many visually impaired peoples out there, expecting some kind of thing that can help them to be self-reliable themselves. So, we would like to bring this concept into reality. We designed a couple of concept design in a 3D modeling CAD tool. We have also integrated Google assistant so that user can able to use google assistant for their home automation systems and can also able to play awesome music on the go using google play music.

POWER CONSUMPTION:-
The Raspberry Pi 3 is powered by a +5.1V micro USB supply. The maximum power the Raspberry Pi can use is 1 Amp. If you need to connect a USB device that will take the power requirements above 1 Amp, then you must connect it to an externally powered USB hub.
